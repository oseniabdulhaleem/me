## key takeways from this [article](https://discord.com/blog/how-discord-supercharges-network-disks-for-extreme-low-latency)

- they use ScyllaNoSQL for their database because it has high throughput
- scyllaDB can handle up 2m reads per seconds
- ScyllaDB is generally used as a key-value store or wide-column model database.(also used by disney hotstar)
----
**Discord runs most of its hardware in Google Cloud and they provide ready access to â€œLocal SSD NVMe based instance storage, which do have incredibly fast latency profiles. Unfortunately, in our testing, we ran into enough reliability issues that we didnâ€™t feel comfortable with depending on this solution for our critical data storage**
----

- you should select disk latency based on the operation(for example discord has more read request compare to write, so it disk specification was the one which has extremely low read disk latency)
