## key takeways from this [article](https://discord.com/blog/how-discord-supercharges-network-disks-for-extreme-low-latency)

- they use ScyllaNoSQL for their database because it has high throughput
**It's no secret that Discord has become your place to talk; the 4 billion messages sent through the platform by millions of people per day have us convinced. But text chat only accounts for a chunk of the features that Discord supports. Server roles, custom emojis, video calls, and more all contribute to the hundreds of terabytes of data we serve to our users.


To provide this enormous amount of data, we run a set of NoSQL database clusters (powered by ScyllaDB), each one the source of truth for their respective data set. As a real-time chat platform, we want our databases to respond to the high frequency of queries as fast as possible.**

- scyllaDB can handle up 2m reads per second
- ScyllaDB is generally used as a key-value store or wide-column model database.(also used by disney hotstar)

**Discord runs most of its hardware in Google Cloud and they provide ready access to â€œLocal SSD NVMe based instance storage, which do have incredibly fast latency profiles. Unfortunately, in our testing, we ran into enough reliability issues that we didnâ€™t feel comfortable with depending on this solution for our critical data storage**


- you should select disk latency based on the operation(for example discord has more read request compare to write, so it disk specification was the one which has extremely low read disk latency)
