# Advice for Parents and Teachers

Parent
* You should guide and assist your children in making choices we shouldn't command them.
* Ask your child what he/she wants, then do it with him/her, don't force rather guide.
* Spend Time asking how he/she is doing.

Teachers

* Teachers should ask the student what/why they are learning today. 
* it gives them the ability to think from a new view.
