water no get enemy as the saying goes

the cway group in nigeria has venture for both water and beverages

they came into the market in 2000 and have been dominating the water dispensing business.

my estimate for their profit is around 100 million dollars per year.

the distributors of their product in each region also see profit since big supermarket isn't mainstream as compared to the US.
